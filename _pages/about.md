I'm a coding wizard and AI trailblazer, currently conquering a Master's in computer science at the prestigious University of Southern California. When I'm not unraveling the latest algorithms or losing my sanity over bugs in my mdoels, you can find me publishing pioneering research on everything from predicting milk yields with machine learning (got milk?!) to optimizing asset management by "borrowing" cohort intelligence from my research mentor, Dr. Anand J. Kulkarni.

While my numerous publications, presentations and patents prove my technical mastery, I'm more than just a prolific programming prodigy. I lead student groups to empower the next generation, like whipping up our own chatbots and computer vision models that would make any tech CEO nervous. I even helped fix bugs in major open source projects!

With a bright future developing disruptive tech ahead, I intend to continue breaking new ground in artificial intelligence while mentoring aspiring young developers to reach their potential. I might just be the most interesting computer scientist around! When Iâ€™m not hacking new frameworks or studying (coursework does make one sweat sometimes), you can catch me running at the tracks or in the city, or roaming around for food!
